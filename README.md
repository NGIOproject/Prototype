NEXTGenIO Prototype
===================

This repository contains files and training material associated with the NEXTGenIO (NGIO) prototype system.

System Configuration
--------------------

The NGIO system consists of 2 login nodes (nextgenio-login1 and nextgenio-login2), and 34 complete compute nodes (CCNs). Each CCN has 2 x 24 core Intel Cascade Lake processors, with 192GB DDR4 and 3TB of Intel Optane DCPMM persistent memory. The nodes are connected by a dual rail Omnipath network.

The NGIO prototype is installed behind a gateway node, hydra-vpn.epcc.ed.ac.uk, which you need to log in to first before accessing the NGIO prototype login nodes.
